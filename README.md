A place to share our collected statistics on the growth of kittens in their early days, powered by data collected by breeders on a daily basis.

We focus on the breeding of british golden shaded cats and provide statistics as references for other breeders.

## Newborn Statistics
We have observed a very strong correlation between the age (days) and the recorded weights, with an average growth of 11.71 g/day. We have also seen a strong correlation between the weight of birth to the rate of growth for the kittens in the first 60 days. From the confidence interval of birth_weight, we can see that kittens born with a heavier body weight tend to grow faster than the other kittens.

We have seen a trend that male kittens tend to have heavier body weight when they were born.

## Daily Consumption Statistics
On average, each adult cat consumes **170 g water** and **65 g cat food (dry)** every day.
